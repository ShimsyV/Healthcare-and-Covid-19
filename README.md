## Description
Our team wanted to tell the story of covid-19 in the United States and the effects of mask use, income and healthcare cost on infections and deaths. 

## Questions
* How strong is the relationship between COVID19 infections and deaths?
* Do states with higher healthcare costs per capita have higher covid-19 infections and/or mortality rates per capita?
* Do states with higher uninsured healthcare rates have higher covid-19 infections and/or mortality rates? 
* Do states with low mask usage have higher rates of covid19 infections?
* Does higher mask use correlate to income levels?
