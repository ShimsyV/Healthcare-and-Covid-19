## Description
The purpose of this project is to look at the mask use, income and healthcare cost and determine if they have an effect on Covid-19 infections and deaths in the United States.

## Questions
* How strong is the relationship between COVID19 infections and deaths?
* Do states with higher healthcare costs per capita have higher covid-19 infections and/or mortality rates per capita?
* Do states with higher uninsured healthcare rates have higher covid-19 infections and/or mortality rates? 
* Do states with low mask usage have higher rates of covid19 infections?
* Does higher mask use correlate to income levels?
