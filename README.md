## Description
The purpose of this project is to look at the barrier of health care and health insurance by state and determine if there is any relationship to covid-19 infection and mortality rates.  Data will also be examined by age, race, and income.

## Questions
* Do states with the higher health care cost have higher covid-19 infections rates?
* Do states with the higher health care cost have higher covid-19 mortality rates?
* Is age a factor?
* Does income level effect this as well?
* Does higher mask use correlate to income levels? Education levels? Race/ethnicity?
